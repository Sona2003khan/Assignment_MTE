A prefix sum array is an array that stores the cumulative sum of elements from the beginning of a given array up to each index. This concept is used to answer range sum queries efficiently.
2. Applications of Prefix Sum Array
✅ 1. Range Sum Queries
Efficiently find the sum of elements between two indices l and r in O(1) time after O(n) preprocessing.
   
✅ 2. Count of Elements in a Range 
In binary arrays (0s and 1s), prefix sums can be used to count how many 1s are present between any two indices.
   
✅ 3. Detecting Subarrays with a Given Sum
Used to check if a subarray with a specific sum exists using prefix sums and hash maps (commonly in more advanced techniques).
